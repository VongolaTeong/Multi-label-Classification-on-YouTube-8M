<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is the team project of CS410 Artificial Intelligence 2020 Fall in Shanghai Jiao Tong University
named Multi-label Classification on YouTube-8M. 
In this project, you are challenged to develop multi-label 
classification algorithms that accurately assign video-level 
labels using YT-8M dataset. Based on the extracted video-level 
features, you are going to develop a Deep Neural Network 
which can learn useful patterns from the features provided 
and predict the 3,862 labels based on learned knowledge.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
This project provides an useful example of application of Deep Neural Network.
